    int a;
    int b;
    int c;

    a=100;
    b=100;
    c=100;
    instead of this we can use the basic like:
    a = b = c = 200
    from the right the measurement will start.It will be something like - if c is 100 then b = c that means b will also be 100.
    this will go on and on...... */
